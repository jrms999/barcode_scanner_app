# barcode_scanner_app



Here's a basic technical outline and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) plan for your AI barcode scanner app that identifies the origin of food purchases (country and continent):

üß† Core Features
Barcode Scanner

Use the phone's camera to scan EAN/UPC barcodes.

Decode the product code in real time.

Product Lookup

Use open databases like:

Open Food Facts API

GS1 (via paid access or scraped alternative)

FoodRepo API (Europe-focused)

Parse manufacturer info, ingredients, and origin if available.

Origin Detection

Country: Use barcode prefix (first 3 digits of EAN-13) to identify registered country of the company.

Continent: Map the country to a continent using ISO country codes.

AI Enhancement (Optional)

Use NLP on product metadata to infer origin if not explicitly listed.

Image recognition of packaging (optional later feature).

Display

Show:

Product name

Country of origin (flag + name)

Continent

Manufacturer

Optionally: sustainability scores, distance traveled, etc.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native (cross-platform: iOS & Android)

Backend: Node.js + Express or Python Flask

Database: Firebase (for MVP) or PostgreSQL

Barcode Scanner: react-native-camera or react-native-vision-camera + @zxing/library

APIs:

Open Food Facts API (free)

Barcode lookup (e.g., UPCitemDB, EANData)

AI: Optional GPT/NLP module for fuzzy origin matching
